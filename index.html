                <h2>Geothermal Valley</h2>
                <p>Our traditional Maori explanation of Te Whakarewarewa Geothermal Valley states that this place was one of the area’s ‘Te Pupu’ and ‘Te Hoata’, the Goddesses of Fire, emerged from the earth’s core while trying to find their brother Ngātoro-i-rangi, who was stranded on Mount Tongariro. As they rose to the surface looking for their brother, they left part of the fire they carried, creating geysers, hot springs and mud pools, creating the geothermal activity that remains today.</p>
                <h3>Fun Facts About Geothermal Valleys</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are over 500 pools and 65 geyser vents, each with their own name, are found in the 70 hectare Te Whakarewarewa geothermal valley in Rotorua.</li>
                    <li>Because New Zealand sits along 2 active techtonic plates, there is a lot of geothermal activity.</li>
                    <li>There are many sites across New Zealand for harvesting energy from these geothermal locations, this type of energy has many benefits such as being relatively cost effective, reliable, sustainable, and relatively environmentally friendly.</li>

                <h2>Pohutu Geiser</h2>
                <p>Our main geyser is called “Pohutu” which means “Big splash” and erupts up to heights of 30 meters. Pohutu is semi-predictable, as she plays 15-20 minutes after another of our active geysers. According to Maori culture, geysers are viewed as gifts from the gods. To the left of Pohutu (when viewing from the bridge) is the “Prince of Wales Feathers” Geyser – named after Prince Edward Albert visited here in the 1900’s. It was traditionally named the “Tohu” or sign as it usually plays 10 mins before and then simultaneously with Pohutu and reaches heights of up to seven metres (almost 23 feet).</p>
                <h3>Fun Facts About Our Pohutu Geiser</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The “Kererū” Geyser erupts every few days from the blackened crater closest to Puarenga Stream. The fan-shaped jet can reach heights of up to 15 metres (just over 49 feet). It is named after the New Zealand Pigeon.</li>
                    <li>Geysers act like a giant pressure cooker on earth, shooting boiling water and steam into the air.</li>
                    <li>All geysers have three components; an intensive heat source, a constant supply of water and an underground plumbing system.</li>
